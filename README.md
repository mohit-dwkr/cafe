## 🛠️ Tools I Used
I used a modern "AI + Developer" workflow to build this fast and efficiently:
* **Lovable (AI):** Used to design the initial UI and pages.
* **VS Code:** Used for manual coding, customization, and fixing logic.
* **Supabase:** My database and authentication system (PostgreSQL).
* **GitHub:** For version control and storing my code.
* **Netlify:** To host the website and make it live.
